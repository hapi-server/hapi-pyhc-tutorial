    "The HAPI server site lists and serves datasets by HAPI endpoint names-- typically multiple per mission, and alphabetic.  It is best when you know which mission you are interested in.  The catalogs currently supported (as of April 2022) are CDAWeb, SSCWeb, AMDA, VirES-for-Swarm, LISIRD, CCMC-ISWA, DAS2 & Datashop.  It is useful for access, less so for searchability.\n",

    "HDP, in turn, only links to the CDAWeb HAPI assets, but has searchability.  For example, a search for 'dst' data and 'hapi' (as keywords) for the time range of Nov-Dec 2021 yields 33 entrie: 8 for Cluster, 24 for MMS, and 1 for OMNI.\n",
    "\n",
