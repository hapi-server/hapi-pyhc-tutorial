    "\n",
    "The Heliophysics Application Programmer's Interface (HAPI) specification allows data providers to use a standard set of conventions for returning data in response to a URL-based request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification was developed because no standard exists. Data providers use incompatible conventions so that automated access to and aggregation of data requires users to write custom code for each data provider.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Finding Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As will be demonstrated, if you know what dataset and parameter you want, a few lines of Python (or IDL, MATLAB, etc.) is all that is needed to get data into your program in a form that is ready for analysis and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HAPI project and HAPI standard covers the \"access\" problem. That is, it makes accessing data easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the HAPI project does not address the \"discovery\" problem of making findinging what you need easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The page [https://hapi-server.org/servers](http://hapi-server.org/servers) contains a complete list of all HAPI servers and their datasets and parameters. It does not contain a global search interface, however. This interface may be useful if you have a general idea of what you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more general searches, there is the [Heliophysics Data Portal (HDP)](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/). With this interface, you can do faceted searches. For example, a search for 'dst' data and 'hapi' (as keywords entered in the \"Text Restriction\" box) for the time range of Nov-Dec 2021 yields 33 entries: 8 for Cluster, 24 for MMS, and 1 for OMNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current, not all data available from HAPI servers is available for search at the [Heliophysics Data Portal (HDP)](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/). There is an on-going effort to make all HAPI data searchable from this interface."
